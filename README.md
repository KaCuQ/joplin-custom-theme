# joplin-custom-theme

Default Joplin theme wasn't satisfying me, so I created this custom theme.
It doesn't change colors, but rather focuses on functionality and aestheticts.

### Changes (for now)
- Hiding text labels for top bar buttons.
- Search bar on right side, expanding on hover.
- Title of note and buttons (labels, note properies and such) in one line.
- Hiding buttons for header, list etc.
- Many of small changes...

### Installation
